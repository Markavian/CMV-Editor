<h1>CMV Movie Editor</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This application lets you edit CMV Movie files created from the game Dwarf Fortress.</p>
<p>Dwarf Fortress is available from http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/</p>
<p>The CMV file format is a compressed ASCII playback that uses a tileset or character set for playback. It is primarily used to export recordings of games in a lossless format to be played back.</p>
<p>An online flash player and supporting archive site for CMV files can be found at the Dwarf Fortress Map Archive - http://mkv25.net/dfma/; over a thousand player created movies can be found there.</p>

<h2>Help</h2>
<p>Please contact Markavian by email at <a href="mailto:dfma@mkv25.net">dfma@mkv25.net</a>, or find him on irc://irc.newnet.net#bay12games if you are having any real difficulty using the software.</p>
<p>Here follows a summary of the features explaining the available tools.</p>

<h3>Main Interface</h3>
<p>The CMV Movie Editor (CMVEditor) can load, save and create CMV and CCMV files. The main interface is divided into several areas; Stage Area, Movie Info, Playback Controls, Timeline, Paint Tools, Timeline Tools.

<h3>Stage Area</h3>
<p>The stage area displays the active frame marked by the playhead on the timeline. When you load a movie file, or create a blank file, the first frame is displayed.</p>
<p>The stage area will update as you play through a movie, using the Playback Controls, and will respond to mouse clicks from Paint Tools.</p>

<h3>Movie Info</h3>
The movie info box will display information about the currently loaded movie. If you have created a new movie from scratch (using File &gt; New...) then the movie file name will be reported as "unsaved".
